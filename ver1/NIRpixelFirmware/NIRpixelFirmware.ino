/* to be used with http://energia.nu/
NIRpixel firmware is designed to be used with Energia environment and TI Launchpad boards.
At defined intervals the firmware outputs space delimited analog measurements of specified channels via serial port available via USB and another serial port if bluetooth-serial converter is present.
